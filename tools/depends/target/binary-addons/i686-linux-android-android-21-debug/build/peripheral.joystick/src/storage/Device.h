   * \brief Record for devices in the button map database
   *
   * Device properties are inherited from kodi::addon::Joystick. These are:
   *
   *   - Device type
   *   - Name                     [ or "" if unknown ]
   *   - USB Vendor ID/Product ID [ or 00:00 if unknown ]
   *   - Driver index
   *   - Provider (driver name)   [ required ]
   *   - Requested Port           [ or -1 for no port requested ]
   *   - Button count
   *   - Hat count
   *   - Axis count
   *   - Motor count
   *
   * This class contains logic for comparing, sorting and combining device
   * records, as well as utility functions.
   *
   * The number of motors is hard-coded in the api section of the code and is
   * not used in the handling logic.
